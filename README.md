The full-stack application has been delpoyed to Heroku. Please click on the following link to view the application. [click here]().

## Description:

In this project , we will build a full-stack text editor application that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
In this text editor , we will implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. This npm package called `idb` will be used.
